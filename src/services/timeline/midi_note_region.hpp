/** A contiguous span of MIDI notes on the timeline.  Peer to Region
 *  (services/timeline/region.hpp) -- the audio + tracker-sequence
 *  region kind -- in the sense that it is itself a region data type,
 *  but stored separately inside Playlist (midiRegions_) because
 *  MidiNoteRegion is non-copyable (atomic snapshot ptr + trash deque)
 *  and cannot live in std::vector<Region> by value.
 *
 *  Thread model -- copies the AutomationRegion (Phase 1) discipline
 *  verbatim:
 *
 *    ONE writer (UI / message thread), ONE reader (audio thread).
 *    The note list is published via a raw pointer atomic swap.  UI
 *    thread builds a new immutable NoteList, atomic_exchanges the
 *    live pointer, and pushes the displaced pointer onto a UI-thread
 *    trash deque drained on AsyncUpdater (or any message-thread tick).
 *    Audio thread atomic_loads once per block and uses the snapshot
 *    for the entire render.
 *
 *  Why leaked-pointer + trash-bin instead of std::atomic<shared_ptr>:
 *  libstdc++ implements atomic<shared_ptr> with an internal spinlock
 *  -- not wait-free and not PI-aware on PREEMPT_RT.  Raw atomic ptr
 *  swap + deferred reclaim is wait-free for the audio reader and
 *  alloc-free for everyone except the UI-thread edit/sweep path.
 *
 *  Phase 2 status: data type only.  The audio thread does NOT yet
 *  consume MidiNoteRegion snapshots (Phase 3 piano-roll lands the
 *  playback path).  The snapshot infrastructure is in place now so
 *  Phase 3 doesn't refactor the storage shape -- just adds the read
 *  side. */
